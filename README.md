Some custom emoji and logo variations for https://social.toplap.org

[Here's the link to the Figma
file](https://www.figma.com/file/LhrOSpDlEhz4fi6Sf2j0Z1/TOPLAP?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=kl1sGX2DOXGi0PmN-1)
where I made these.

Also included is an Haskell emoji. The base artwork for it was taken from
[Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Haskell-Logo.svg), where it
says we have permission to use that SVG.

### Sizes

Logo is 1024x1024 px. There is a variation with a transparent background (though
the one with the transparent background is risky to use if it is shown on a dark
page).

Custom emoji's are 520x520 px, and are made such that they should look okay at
smaller sizes, say 20x20, but I might need to tweak things depending on how they
look when they're actually used.
